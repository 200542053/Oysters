7/01/19 - Brainstorming Outline:
* ~~Oysters generate in certain biomes. probably warm and on sand only~~
* ~~oysters create pearls.  resource oysters create resource pearls~~
* ~~Breeding Oysters to create resource oysters~~
    * ~~Block(Oyster Baskets)~~.
    * ~~This has two input slots, one for an oyster and one for a resource~~
    * ~~The more oysters you have stacked, the faster you produce pearls/more oysters.  (need at least 2 oysters to create more oysters)~~
    * ~~will rarely create a new oyster.~~
* ~~crafting resource pearls creates the item (9 iron pearls create an iron ingot)~~
* ~~Oyster Baskets Will also just hold the Oysters and Harvest them automatically~~

7/14/19 - New ideas for the oysters:
   * ~~Add tiers of regular oysters to gate resource oysters~~
        * ~~Tier 1 - blemished pearl oysters: can mutate with resources: bone meal, coal...~~
        * ~~Tier 2 - clean pearl oysters: iron, redstone, glowstone, lapis~~
        * ~~Tier 3 - flawless pearl oysters: gold, diamond, emerald, ender pearl~~
        
        * ~~Higher tier oysters are mutated with the pearl you are attempting to create.(to go from a 
   blemished oyster to a clean oyster, mutate a set of blemished oysters with clean oyster pearls)~~
        * ~~higher tier pearls can be crafted in a 3x3 with the lower teir.  3x3 blemished pearls = 1 clean pearl)~~
   
   * flawless oyster pearls can be used to craft stuff to help you under water.  Ideas given were -
   underwater breathing.  
   * possible idea is a crafted arrow with a flawless pearl that can be used underwater

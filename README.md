[mod download](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oysters)

Brainstorming Outline:
* Oysters generate in certain biomes. probably warm and on sand only
* oysters create pearls.  resource oysters create resource pearls
* Breeding Oysters to create resource oysters
    * Block(Oyster Baskets).
    * This has two input slots, one for an oyster and one for a resource
    * The more oysters you have stacked, the faster you produce pearls/more oysters.  (need at least 2 oysters to create more oysters)
    * will rarely create a new oyster.
* crafting resource pearls creates the item (9 iron pearls create an iron ingot)
* Oyster Baskets Will also just hold the Oysters and Harvest them automatically
